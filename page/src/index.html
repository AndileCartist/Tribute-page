              <h2 class="sub-heading">Who is Pep?</h2>
              <p>Josep "Pep" Guardiola Sala (Catalan pronunciation: [ʒuˈzɛb ɡwəɾðiˈɔlə]; born 18 January 1971) is a Spanish professional football manager and former player, who is the current manager of Premier League club Manchester City. He is considered to be one of the greatest managers of all time. He holds the record for the most consecutive league games won in La Liga, the Bundesliga and the Premier League.
                Guardiola was a defensive midfielder who usually played in a deep-lying playmaker's role. He spent the majority of his career with Barcelona, forming a part of Johan Cruyff's Dream Team that won the club's first European Cup in 1992, and four successive Spanish league titles from 1991 to 1994. He later captained the team from 1997 until his departure from the club in 2001. After leaving Barcelona, Guardiola had stints with Brescia and Roma in Italy, Al-Ahli in Qatar, and Dorados de Sinaloa in Mexico. He was capped 47 times for the Spanish national team and appeared at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, as well as at UEFA Euro 2000. He also played friendly matches for Catalonia.

              <h2 class="sub-heading">What makes him so special</h2>
              <p>
                Guardiola demands energy and running power from full-back—and few in the City squad can match the 26-year-old’s fitness. Whether he has the technical qualities needed to excel there remains to be seen, but there’s certainly scope to deploy the former Aston Villa man differently to the way he was in his debut season.
                Fernandinho looks to be one of the most adaptable in the squad. He showed last season during a two-game stint on the right of midfield that he has an understanding of tactics that allows him to move effortlessly into unfamiliar roles. Guardiola, who appreciates versatility, is going to love him.
                He can play as a box-to-box midfielder, as he has for the majority of his time at City, or more defensively. He could easily play as an attack-minded right-back or on the right of a three-man defence. There are few holes in his game, and the options of how to use him are numerous.
                And then there’s the Yaya Toure conundrum. It’s clear he is no longer capable of playing the box-to-box role with the same brilliance he once did, but he has too many world-class attributes to be discarded easily.
                City need a deep-lying playmaker, someone with an excellent range of passing who can orchestrate their attacks. Toure, the finest passer in the City squad, is more than capable.
                In an illuminating interview with the FIFA website back in 2011, Guardiola simplified tactics, saying the key is finding the right roles for the players you have at your disposal.
